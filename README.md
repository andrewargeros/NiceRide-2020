# NiceRide-2020
 Work on NiceRide bike sharing program in Minneapolis

## Data
This comes from 3 main .csv files included in the repo. First, `Nice_Ride_2017_Station_Locations` details the location and number of docks at the station. `Nice_ride_trip_history_2017_season` is a trip log of every trip taken on a NiceRide bike in the 2017 Season. There is also a Minneapolis weather file included to show daily metrics in the city.

## Analysis
Much of the included analysis is spatial in nature and thus relies upon mapping packages. For this, Open Maps Service and Open Route Services were used. In order to convert coordinates to Zip Codes, web scraping was performed to accomplish this as well.
